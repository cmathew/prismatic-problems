		<h1>Question 2</h1>
		<b>Note:</b> For this problem, you may use jQuery. The most recent version
		 is already included in this document. 
		 

		<h3> Friend List </h3>
		<button id='delete-friends' style='display:none'>Delete Friends</button>
		<div>					
			<ul id='friends-list'>
				<li>Sample Friend 1</li>
				<li>Sample Friend 2</li>
			</ul>							
		</div>


		<h3> Part 1: Display friends </h3>

		
		<div width="200px">
			<p>
		For this question, you will attach a listener to an API method (see <code>api.listenForFriendChanges</code> in <a href='question2.js'>question2.js</a>). Your listener
		will be called when the user's friends change and it will be called with an array of actions. 

		Each action will be formatted as either an <it>add</it> message:
		<pre>
		<code>
			{action: 'add', friend:{id:42, name:'Mr. New Friend', strength:0.9}}
		</code>
		</pre>

		Or a <it>remove</it> message:
		<pre>
		<code>
			{action: 'remove', friend:{id:43, name:'Mr. No longer Friend',strength:0.6}}
		</code>
		</pre>

		 While receiving changes from the 'backend', you will be displaying a live updating list 
		 of user friend names in the HTML list above ('ul#friends-list'). When a friends gets added, they should be appened to the bottom of the list and should disappear if removed.

		 You should remove the sample friends listed above on document load. 

		</div>



		<h3> Part 2: Deleting Friends </h3>

		 Let the user delete friends from the list. When a user clicks a name,
		 <ol>
		 	<li>Change the color of the name to red to indicate a pending delete OR 
		 		back to black if it was already red to undo the pending action. 
		 	<li>Show or hide the 'Delete Friends' button ('button#delete-button' in the HTML) 
		 		if there is at least one pending delete or not. 
		 	<li>When the user clicks the 'Delete Friends' button, any selected names should be
		 		submitted <code>api.submitUserChanges</code> as an array of 'remove' actions like in Part 1. Obviously, the names should be removed from the list. Note that the friend update listener from Part 1 will <b>NOT</b> call you for changes initiated by the user.
 		 </ol>
		 
		 
		 Remember, when you submit the users for deletion, you need the whole friend object, not just the name. You must include the id, name, and strength fields you were passed down. 

		 Also, remember that the backend can delete a user which has a pending delete. In that case, the user should be immediately removed from the list.

		</div>
		<p>
		<b>Bonus:</b> What's the probability of having a list of length 9 after three update calls
		from <code>api.listenForFriendChanges</code>?
