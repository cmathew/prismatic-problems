		<h1> Prismatic JS Questions </h1>

		<p>
		You have two hours to complete two questions. Each question has it's own HTML and you 
		should write your code in the associated JS file linked in the question (the place where you should write code is marked with <code>YOUR CODE HERE</code>). 

		<p>
		You <b>shouldn't</b> use any third-party JS libraries not explicitly allowed. Question 2 will
		let you use jQuery if you want. Assume, where it matters, that you can use any JS allowed
		by the latest stable Chrome, because that's where will run stuff. 

		<p>
		<b>Email back question1.js and question2.js, and question3.js in two hours. Good Luck!</b>
