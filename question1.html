		<h3>Question 1</h3>
		<div width="200px">
			<p>
		For this question, you will make two concurrent calls
		to an api and perform an action after both have returned. See the <code>api</code> variable in <a href="question1.js">question1.js</a>. 

		<p>
		The
		two calls are <code>api.getUserInfo</code> and <code>api.getUserFriends</code>.
		Both of them take a callback function which will be asynchronously
		called with a user info object and a user friends array respectively. 

		<p>

		Once the page loads, you should make requests to <code>api.getUserInfo</code>
		and <code>api.getUserFriends</code> and once both have returned with data, two things needs to happen:
		<ol>
			<li>The <code>userData</code> variable (see 'question1.js') should
				be set to the array <code>[userInfo,userFriends]</code> pair.</li>
			<li>Pop up an alert with the user name. Which is the <code>userInfo.name</code>
				property from <code>api.getUserInfo</code>.</li>
		</ol> 

		<p>
		<b>Note 1:</b> You are being evaluated on not just a correct solution, but writing
		code which has reusable abstractions. Think about a pattern you're doing here
		you may want to re-use. What if you had to wait for an arbitrary number of calls to return instead of just twox?
		<p>
		<b>Note 2:</b> Do not make serial requests for info and friends. 
		<p>
		<b>Bonus:</b> What's the probability the user info comes back before
		the friends call?
